* Moved to C++17 and removed Boost as a dependency
* Updated to use CodeSynthesis XSD 4.0
* Updated to use OpenSim 4.0 or later
* Updated to use newest version of Concurrency with improved handling of end of queue data
* Added MaxSumPeak objective function for calibration

CEINMS 0.11.0
--------------
* Add CEINMSoptimise executable to automatically estimate alpha, beta, gamma weightings for the EMG-assisted execution

CEINMS 0.10.1
--------------
* Fix minor bugs when calculating contact forces

CEINMS 0.10.0
-------------
* Changed solver for hybrid, EMG-assisted, and static optimisation modes
* Simplified XML to configure hybrid, EMG-assisted, and static optimisation modes
* Remove the need to have an excitation input file when running static optimisation
* Order does not matter for the generated signals in the excitation generator file
* Added warning messages when signals in the excitation generator file do not correspond to MTU in the subject model
* Show torque errors during calibration
* Added calibration parallelisation, when calibrating multiple trials at the same time, the load is split into different CPUs
* Fix minor bugs
