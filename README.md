## Configuration

### settings.json

The `settings.json` file contains all the necessary paths and configuration parameters for conducting a complete musculoskeletal analysis of a single participant during powerlifting movements.

Key sections include:
- **Input paths**: Motion capture data, force plates, EMG, anthropometric measurements, and video files
- **Model paths**: OpenSim models, templates, and marker protocols
- **Configuration paths**: Calibration files, protocols, and analysis settings
- **Output paths**: Kinematics, kinetics, muscle analysis results, reports, and visualizations
- **Analysis parameters**: Sampling rates, filtering settings, coordinate systems, and units

This configuration supports analysis of squat, bench press, and deadlift movements with comprehensive biomechanical output.
