# Models Directory

This directory contains the biomechanical models and markersets used in the powerlifting analysis.

## Structure

- `opensim_models/`: Contains OpenSim (.osim) model files
- `markersets/`: Contains marker set definitions (.xml files) for motion capture

## Usage

Place your OpenSim models in the `opensim_models/` folder and your marker set definitions in the `markersets/` folder. These will be used by the simulation pipeline to perform biomechanical analysis of powerlifting movements.

## Recommended Models

- Full-body musculoskeletal models suitable for powerlifting analysis
- Models with detailed lower extremity and spine representation
- Models compatible with the marker sets used in your motion capture setup
