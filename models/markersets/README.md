# Marker Sets

This directory contains marker set definitions (.xml files) for motion capture data.

## File Organization

- Place your marker set `.xml` files here
- Use descriptive names that match your motion capture setup
- Include documentation about marker placement protocols

## Usage

These marker sets define the virtual markers used in OpenSim for:
- Inverse kinematics
- Model scaling
- Motion tracking

## Recommended Structure

- Include marker sets for different capture volumes or setups
- Document any changes to standard marker sets
- Ensure consistency with your motion capture laboratory setup
