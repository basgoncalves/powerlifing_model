# OpenSim Models

This directory contains OpenSim (.osim) model files used for biomechanical analysis.

## File Organization

- Place your `.osim` model files here
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `full_body_powerlifting_model.osim`)
- Include any scaling setup files if needed

## Notes

- Ensure models are compatible with OpenSim 4.x
- Models should be validated for the specific movements being analyzed
- Consider including different models for different analysis types (kinematics, dynamics, muscle analysis)
