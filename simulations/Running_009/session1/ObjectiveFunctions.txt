Standard
- MomentError: joint moment tracking
	- targets: list of DOF names or "all". Defaults to all if not provided
	- weight
- Penalty: penalises values outside of range (NOTE: tendonStrain is included when using elastic tendon)
	- targetType: options: normalisedFibreLength, tendonStrain
	- targets: list of muscle names or "all". Defaults to all if not provided
	- weight

Synergy-hybrid calibration specific
- ExcitationsSquared: sum of excitations squared, similar to beta term in EMG-assisted NMS execution
	- weight
- SynergyExtraction: penalises synergy weighting and primitives outside of range and tracks the synergy reconstructed with the experimental excitations
	- mseWeight: weight for the excitation tracking
	- range: penalties range
	- rangeExponent: penalties exponent
	- rangeWeight: penalties weight

Other
- MaxSumPeak: minimises peak muscle forces
